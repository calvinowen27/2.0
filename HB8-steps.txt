1. Block pixels (per channel)
    a. look at pixels in 4x4 chunks
    b. pick reference values (min/max)
    c. assign indexes (between 0-3) to all 16 pixels based on closest reference value (including lin-interpolated values)
        i. do linear interpolation between reference values to get middle 2 reference values
    d. make sure values are stored separated by channel and block
        i. stored values should consist of outside 2 reference values and 16 indexes

2. Convert block indexes to huffman code
    a. Write huffman coding function(s)
    b. Store huffman-coded blocks separately from original blocks
        i. reference values should be unchanged
